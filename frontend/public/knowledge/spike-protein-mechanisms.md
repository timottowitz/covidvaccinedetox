## Key Points

- Spike protein binds to ACE2 receptors with high affinity
- Causes endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation
- Triggers immune system dysregulation
- Associated with long-term cardiovascular effects

## Summary

This document analyzes the various mechanisms by which the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein affects human physiology. The spike protein's primary function is viral entry through ACE2 receptor binding, but emerging research shows additional pathological effects including direct cellular toxicity, immune system modulation, and vascular damage.

## Cellular Effects

The spike protein can cause:
1. Direct cytotoxicity through membrane disruption
2. Mitochondrial dysfunction leading to oxidative stress
3. Complement activation and inflammatory cascades
4. Coagulation abnormalities and microthrombi formation

## Therapeutic Implications

Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies that address both acute infection and long-term sequelae of COVID-19.
